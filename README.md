# Task List in This Directory:

These tasks were implemented by me during my first year at Moscow State University in the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. The course focused on the theory of algorithms.

To interact with the program, input values into the "in.txt" file. The desired result will be written to the "out.txt" file.

- ✅ [**check_intersection**](https://github.com/dream1ike/Algoritms-1-semester-msu/tree/main/check_intersection "check_intersection") - Checks for the intersection of two lines.
- 🚧 [**double_linked_list**](https://github.com/dream1ike/Algoritms-1-semester-msu/tree/main/double_linked_list "double_linked_list") (in progress) - Creating a doubly linked list.
- ✅ [**get_binary_form**](https://github.com/dream1ike/Algoritms-1-semester-msu/tree/main/get_binary_form "get_binary_form") - Retrieves the binary form from a number.
- ✅ [**number_of_occurrences**](https://github.com/dream1ike/Algoritms-1-semester-msu/tree/main/number_of_occurrences "number_of_occurrences") - Counts the occurrences of a substring in a string.
- ✅ [**row_with_largest_amount**](https://github.com/dream1ike/Algoritms-1-semester-msu/tree/main/row_with_largest_amount "row_with_largest_amount") - Finds the row in a matrix with the largest sum.
